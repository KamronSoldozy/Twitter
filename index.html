<u>Hi! Welcome to our Twitter Project!</font></u>

Our Twitter project has a very unique application to it. With it, we wish to unite people together who share a very unique connection: ancestry!
Our program will loop through a government issued list of common names, and will tweet at them a message with your last name, checking if they are part of your family.
For now, the program defaults to our amazing CS Teacher, Mr. Rudwick. 
In order to circumvent Twitter's limits on tweets per day, we've added a Thread to tweet over time. Adjust this to your preference!
